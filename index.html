      <p>We have some of the best beaches in all of Florida. Be ready to be one with nature. You will not find any high rises anywhere on the island. Come see the pristine bay marshes and enjoy the extraordinary stunning views and don't forget to watch the sunset.</p>

      <p>The Blue Parrot is one of our biggest and most popular restaurants on the island. You can enjoy a nice coke and burger with an ocean view. We have the freshest seafood on the island. You can grab a drink and go for a walk in the sugary white sand.</p>
